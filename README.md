# Water-Potability
In this project, I analyzed the properties of more than 3000 water samples to determine whether the water is potable. By machineâ€‘learning algorithms, I developed a classification prediction model for predicting the Potability of future samples to accelerate the examination and distribution of water in areas without safe drinking water.

There are R and R markdown files that can be opened by RStudio and if you'd like to see the plots and results you're to download the HTML file and open it. Hope you find it useful :)

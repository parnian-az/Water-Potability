# Water-Potability
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

In this project, I analyzed the properties of more than 3000 water samples to determine whether the water is potable. By machineâ€‘learning algorithms, I developed a classification prediction model for predicting the Potability of future samples to accelerate the examination and distribution of water in areas without safe drinking water.

There are R and R markdown files that can be opened by RStudio and if you'd like to see the plots and results, you're to download the HTML file and open it on your own PC. Hope you find it useful :)

# Water-Potability
In this project, I analyzed the properties of more than 3000 water samples to determine whether the water is potable. By machineâ€‘learning algorithms, I developed a classification prediction model for predicting the Potability of future samples to accelerate the examination and distribution of water in areas without safe drinking water.
